### Key Takeaways and Learning Experiences

    Some observations regarding the process of this project from start to finish:
    -Time management is one of the most important parts of the process. Knowing when it is time to work on a different aspect of a project definitely helps reevaluate issues when you are stuck by returning with a fresh outlook.
    -Ensuring the core elements of a project are addressed prior to jumping ahead in the process.
    -Ensuring that classes/ids and divs are easily observed for their functional purpose.
    -Prior to starting the project ensure that all Github repositories have been cloned to the local drive prior to the projects being worked to prevent any submission delays as well as giving ample time to provide update comments regarding the status of the project.
